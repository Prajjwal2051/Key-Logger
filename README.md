3. Click Generate app password
4. Choose Mail as app type
5. Save the generated password

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Run the Program
Execute the keylogger using: python keylogger.py

### 2. Configure Email Settings
The program will prompt you to enter:
- Sender Email: Your email address
- Sender Password: Your App Password (not regular password)
- Recipient Email: Where to send the keylog

### 3. Start Keylogging
- The program will begin capturing keystrokes
- All input is logged to keylog.txt
- Real-time feedback is displayed in the console

### 4. Stop and Send Report
- Press Escape to stop the keylogger
- The program automatically emails the log file
- Check the recipient's email for the keylog report

## üìÅ File Structure

Key-Logger/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keylogger.py (Main keylogger script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keylog.txt (Generated log file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (This file)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt (Python dependencies)

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Keystroke Capture
- Uses pynput.keyboard.Listener to monitor keyboard events
- Captures both regular characters (a, b, 1, 2) and special keys (Ctrl, Alt, Space)
- Logs all events with timestamps

### 2. Data Storage
- Saves keystrokes to keylog.txt using Python's logging module
- Includes timestamps for each keystroke
- Handles file creation and management automatically

### 3. Email Reporting
- Automatically detects email provider and uses appropriate SMTP server
- Creates MIME multipart message with log file attachment
- Uses secure TLS encryption for email transmission
- Supports Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and other major providers

### 4. Security Features
- Uses App Passwords instead of regular passwords
- Hides password input using getpass module
- Validates email address format
- Provides clear error messages for troubleshooting

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Email Provider Settings
The program automatically detects SMTP settings based on your email domain:

Gmail: smtp.gmail.com:587 (TLS)
Outlook/Hotmail: smtp-mail.outlook.com:587 (TLS)
Yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com:587 (TLS)

### Custom SMTP Configuration
To use a different email provider, modify the get_smtp_server() function in the code.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failed Error
- Solution: Use App Password, not regular password
- Gmail: Generate App Password in Google Account Security
- Outlook: Generate App Password in Microsoft Account Security

#### No Module Named 'pynput' Error
Solution: Install pynput using: pip install pynput

#### Permission Denied Error
- Linux/macOS: Run with sudo if needed
- Windows: Run as Administrator
- Solution: Some systems require elevated permissions for keyboard monitoring

#### Email Not Received
- Check spam folder
- Verify recipient email address
- Ensure sender email has proper App Password
- Check internet connection

### Getting Help
1. Check error messages in console
2. Verify email setup following this guide
3. Test with a simple email first
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Log files contain sensitive information - handle carefully
- Consider encrypting log files for additional security
- Delete log files after use if not needed
- Use secure channels when sharing logs

### Access Control
- Store App Passwords securely
- Don't hardcode credentials in the source code
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate App Passwords

### Legal Compliance
- Obtain proper authorization before deployment
- Follow local privacy and surveillance laws
- Provide appropriate disclosure when monitoring
- Maintain audit trails for authorized use
